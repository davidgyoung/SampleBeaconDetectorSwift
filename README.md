# Sample Application for detecting beacons in the background on iOS using Swift

To test this app, install the BeaconScope app from the AppStore or Google Play Store on a second phone, and use it as a beacon transmitter.  Then run this app from XCode and change the UUID, major and minor to match your transmitter.
Detections can be verified in the on screeen log, which is updated even in the background.
